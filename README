INTRODUCTION

Atto is an ultra-tiny self-contained testing framework inspired by 
and partially based on nanotest by mynyml. It is self-contained in that it 
needs no external libraries. Every file in this project is, and will remain
under 100 lines long, comments included.

USAGE

To use it in your tests, for every ruby file lib/foo/bar.rb in your project,
make a test file lib/foo/test_bar.rb and start it with:

require 'atto'
include Atto::Test

# Then you can add tests like this:
assert "A test that will always suceed" do true end
# Or like this :
assert { Foo::Bar }

Then run the command atto from your project directory and it will run the tests
in the test directory automatically, and then, every time you change either a 
lib file or a test file, it will run the relevant test again. It will also 
detect new files being added.
