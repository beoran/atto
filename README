INTRODUCTION

Atto is an ultra-tiny self-contained testing framework inspired by 
and partially based on nanotest by mynyml. It is self-contained in that it 
needs no external libraries. Every ruby file in this project is, and will remain
under 100 lines long, comments included.

USAGE

To use it in your tests, for every ruby file lib/foo/bar.rb in your project,
make a test file lib/foo/test_bar.rb and start it with:

require 'atto'
include Atto::Test

# Then you can add tests like this:
assert "A test that will always suceed" do true end
# Or like this :
assert { Foo::Bar }

Then run the command atto from your project directory and it will run the tests
in the test directory automatically, and then, every time you change either a 
lib file or a test file, it will run the relevant test again. It will also 
detect new files being added. 

Since version 0.9.1, atto has a tiny command line and environment options
module, and the atto command understands the following command line options:
  --help        -h      Display a help message. 
  --project=dir -pdir   Sets project directory.
  --lib=sub     -lsub   Sets project library subdirectory.
  --test=sub    -tsub   Sets project test subdirectory.
  --skip        -s      Skips tests on startup.
  
Unknown options will be completely ignored. You may also set the corresponding 
environment variables ATTO_HELP, ATTO_PROJECT, ATTO_LIB, ATTO_TEST, ATTO_SKIP
for the same effect as the command line options.

Most useful here is the --skip option which allows you to skip running all tests 
on startup. This is invaluable for projects that have many slow-running tests.
The help message made run.rb reach the 99 lines limit, so it looks like no new 
features will be implemented in the atto command. :)

To clear out any possible misunderstandings, --project is used to set the 
project directory, --test and --lib are used to specify *sub*directory names.
It is currently required that the test dir and the lib dir are subdirectories 
of the project directory.

For example:

atto --project=~/src/foo --lib=libs --test=tests 

Will run the tests in ~/src/foo/tests for the library files in ~/src/foo/libs.
